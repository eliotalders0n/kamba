                <h3>How we keep your data secure</h3>
                <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of processing and the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services as such relate to personal data that we hold, in order to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure or access.
                In our roles as both controller and processor, we implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of information security appropriate to the risk. Our IT infrastructure and software applications are built to provide secure deployment of services, encrypted storage of back-up data with end-user privacy safeguards, encrypted communications between services, and safe operation by customers.
                Additionally, our employees, associates and Kamba Practitioners are bound to comply with confidentiality provisions and privacy policies and procedures, in addition to completing mandatory privacy & security awareness training. We have various policies that specifically address responsibilities and expected behaviour with respect to the protection of confidential information.
                We have procedures for incident and breach investigation and notification. Where our assessment of the likely risk to the individuals involved concludes a breach of personal data may result in risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we shall promptly inform individuals (and associated controllers and the relevant supervisory authority where applicable) of any such breach, as required by law and in accordance with any contractual terms.
                You should note that where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a username and/or password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, or use our products and services, you are responsible for keeping the username and password confidential. You should not share these details with anyone.
                This General Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Kamba and its group of companies. Links within our website to third party sites, plug-ins and applications are not covered by this General Privacy Policy. If you link to other websites, we encourage you to read their own privacy policies. We are not responsible or liable for those policies.</p>
                <h3>Data retention and anonymization</h3>
                <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the data, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
                The periods that we retain data for are set out in our internal Data Retention and Destruction Policies. This sets out the types of data that Kamba collects and the retention periods and destruction methods for such data.
                To determine the appropriate retention periods for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process the personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, together with applicable legal requirements, including certain statutory retention periods. For example, by law, we have to keep: (i) certain customer and supplier information for seven years for tax and audit requirements:
                We do not store credit/debit card information nor do we share customers details with any 3rd parties.
                If you require further information on specific retention periods, please contact us.</p>
                <h3>Your legal rights</h3>
                <p>You have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “subject access request” or “SAR”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. We have a Subject Access Request policy which sets out in brief our process for dealing with SARs.</li>
                <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
                <li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                <li>Object to processing of your personal data. This enables you to object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent. You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent as the legal basis on which we process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdrew your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <P>Where we are a processor in respect of your personal data, we will inform the relevant controller of your request and assist and co-operate with the controller for them to fulfil the request.
                You normally will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, if a request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee. Alternatively, in certain circumstances, we may refuse to comply with your request.</P>
                <h3>Further information</h3>
                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity or verify your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
                <h3>Changes to your personal data</h3>
                <p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. In order for us to ensure this, please keep us informed of any changes at any time to the personal data that we hold about you.</p>
                <h3>How you can contact us and your right to complain</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions about this General Privacy Policy or data protection or privacy matters generally, request to access, correct or delete personal data, withdraw consent or other requests, please contact Sigma’s Data Protection officer:
                Whilst we hope that you will not need to, if you do wish to complain about how we handle personal data, you may contact our Data Protection Officer as above.
                You also have the right to complain to the relevant data protection Supervisory Authority. </p>

                <h3>Status of privacy policy and changes</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy is effective from 1st July,2019 . We may change it from time to time so please check regularly to keep informed of updates.
